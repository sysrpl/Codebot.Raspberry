# Codebot.Raspberry.Board

The Codebot.Raspberry.Board assembly is based off the [Microsoft IoT](https://github.com/dotnet/iot) dotnet core project. The classes in this project have been redesigned to work with the Raspberry Pi and assumes your Pi is running a Linux operating system thus simplfying development with Linux based Raspberry Pis and this assembly. The I/O classes within this project are abstracted by the [Raspberry](/Raspberry/README.md) project and you should not need to interact with any of the classes in this project.
