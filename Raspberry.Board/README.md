# Raspberry.Board

The Raspberry.Board is based off the [Microsoft IoT](https://github.com/dotnet/iot) dotnet core project. the code in this project has been redesigned to work with the Raspberry Pi and assumes your Pi is running a Linux operating system. The I/O classes within this project are abstracted by the [Raspberry](/Raspberry/README.md) project and you should not need to interact with any of the classes in this project.
