Our goal is to create a set of world-class APIs and tooling that will support a rich .NET IoT ecosystem.  Below shows a structure of components as part of our roadmap.

## Deliverables for vNext/Future

The following deliverables are not in any particular order:
* [ ] Add bindings for more devices
* [ ] Add/Test support on more boards
* [ ] Onboard more customers and work on making them successful
* [ ] Improve the Eventing APIs for the SysFS driver for GPIO (#378)
* [ ] Add infrastructure required for servicing bindings package
* [ ] Improve documentation for onboarding, adding device bindings, working with samples
* [ ] Improve the abstraction for devices in Iot.Device.Bindings package
* [ ] Collaborate with IoT Plug and Play
* [ ] Add E2E sample that leverages Azure IoT Hub to showcase the integration with Azure services
* [ ] Add testing for I2C, SPI, PWM protocols
* [ ] Add testing infrastructure for IoT.Device.Bindings
* [ ] Add control engineering algorithms (for example: PID)
* [ ] Support new protocols; for example I2S.
* [ ] Support common serial protocols: RS-485 Serial Port, Modbus, 1-wire
* [ ] Publish Docker images for a subset of samples
