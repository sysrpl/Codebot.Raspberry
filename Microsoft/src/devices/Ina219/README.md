# INA219 - Bidirectional Current/Power Monitor

## Summary

The INA219 is a current shunt and power monitor with an I2C- or SMBUS-compatible interface. The device monitors both shunt voltage drop and bus supply voltage, with programmable conversion times and filtering. A programmable calibration value, combined with an internal multiplier, enables direct readouts of current in amperes. An additional multiplying register calculates power in watts. The I2C- or SMBUS-compatible interface features 16 programmable addresses

* Senses Bus Voltages from 0 to 26 V
* Reports Current, Voltage, and Power
* 16 Programmable Addresses
* High Accuracy: 0.5% (Maximum) Over Temperature (INA219B)
* Filtering Options
* Calibration Registers

## Device Family

This binding is intended to support both the A and B grades of the INA219. The grades differ only in the accuracy and precision specifications.
